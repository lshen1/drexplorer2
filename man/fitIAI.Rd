\details{
Two papers have been published by Lee et al, one in 2007 (Lee2007) and on in 2009 (Lee2009).
 The Lee2007 paper described five methods to assess interaction: (1) Lowewe additivity model
 using interaction index (IAI) (2) Model of Greco et al 1990. This approach uses
 \deqn{\alpha}{alpha} as the metric and it can be related to IAI (3) Model of Machado and
 Robinson which uses a metric denoted as \deqn{\eta}{eta} (4) Model of Plummer and Short which
 can also be linked to IAI through the parameter \deqn{\beta_4}{beta_4} (5) Model of Carter
 et al that can be linked to IAI through the parameter \deqn{\beta_{12}}{beta_12}. For more
 details of these models, please refer to Lee2007.

The Lee2009 paper provided generalization of IAI to multiple drugs using Lowewe additivity
 model and assumption of Chou and Talalay's median effect equation. The Chou and Talalay's
 median effect equation can be expressed as: 
 \deqn{log(E/(1-E))=m(log d - log Dm)}{log(E/(1-E))=m(log d - log Dm)} 
 where E is the effect at dose d for a compound whose median effective dose. 

Some notes about experiment design. Usually the data is either fixed ratio design (ray design)
 or grid design which means all-possible combination of drug concentrations between two drugs
 are available. The Lee2007 paper provided an example of grid design. However, specific fixed
 ratio is used to fit the median effect model which is the basis to estimate IAI. The Lee2009
 paper considered with fixed ratio design.
