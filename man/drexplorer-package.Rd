\description{
There is a great variety of models developed for dose-response data, many of which have been
 implemented in the drc and DoseFinding packages. drexplorer combines both packages to aid
 the user to visually examine and compare how existing models perform on the data. Another
 important feature for drexplorer is to allow the user to identify outlier measurements and
 visually examine how these outliers affect the fitted model.
