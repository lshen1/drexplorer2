\title{Identifying outliers with the range to standard deviation ratio statistic.}
\usage{
NewmanTest(ref, obs, alpha = 0.01, recursive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{a vector giving the reference values to estimate sigma.}

\item{obs}{a vector giving the observed values where potential outlier might exist.}

\item{alpha}{significance level. Only 0.01, 0.05 or 1 is allowed.}

\item{recursive}{whether to recursively identify outliers. Currently not implemented.}
}
\value{
indicator a logical vector specifying if the corresponding point is flagged as outlier.
}
\description{
This function implements the method described by D. Newman, Biometrika, 1939 to identify outliers.
}
\details{
Given measurements from controls (no drug treated), we can compute the sample
 standard deviation (s). The range of responses from treated samples (w) can be computed
 for a given dose level. Assuming the controls to have the same variation as the drug treated case, 
 the distribution of ratio statistic q=w/s can be derived and used to calculate if there is
 outliers in the treated responses as described by D. Newman, Biometrika, 1939.  

Note that this function works for a single dose level. When multiple dose levels exist,
 one need to repeatedly call this function to identify outliers at each dose level or use the
 flagOutliers() function which is just a wrapper.

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
y <- c(rnorm(5, 0, 1), rnorm(1, 0, 1) + 4)
# the last observation in y is an outlier
NewmanTest(x, y, alpha = 0.05)
