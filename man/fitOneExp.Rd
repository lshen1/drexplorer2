\title{Fit multiple dose response models for a single drug in a single cell line (One experiement unit)}
\usage{
fitOneExp(
  dat,
  drug = NA,
  cellLine = NA,
  unit = NA,
  models = c("LL.3", "LL.3u", "sigEmax", "logistic", "linlog"),

\arguments{
\item{dat}{a 2-column data frame with first column as dose and second column response.
Controls are decided by dose = 0.}

\item{drug}{drug for this analysis.}

\item{cellLine}{cell line for this analysis.}

\item{unit}{unit of drug concentration.}

\item{models}{models the user may specify.}

\item{cols}{colors of dose-response curves.}

\item{log.d}{in computed ICx values, whether to return the log10 dose or the dose without
this transformation.}

\item{percentile}{IC percentile.}

\item{alpha}{outlier significance level.}

\item{fitCtr}{whether the model is fitted with control data.}

\item{standardize}{whether to standardize (scale) the data based on control points.
This should be disabled when no control data is supplied.}

\item{interpolation}{whether calculate ICx through interpolation or through root finding.
This parameter is passed to computeIC() function. When interpolation = TRUE, ICx value will
be bounded by observed minimum and maximum dose; otherwise, ICx is calculated through root
finding and thus can be outside this boundary (extrapolated).}

\item{plot}{whether to draw the dose response curve.}

\item{transparency}{a value between 0 and 1 specifying transparency through alpha blending;
transparency = 0 means totally transparent.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to plotOneExp().}
}
\value{
a list containing elements with:

fits, 

models, 

cols,

ICmat, IC matrix from all specified models as well as RSE and model name

ICx, IC values from the best model  

datWithOutlierStatus the input data with outlier status appended

bestModel the best model by RSE 

RSEs
}
\description{
The dose response mode is usually fitted with original dose (not log10 transformed). The
 computed ICx values however, can be in either log10 scale or the original scale.
