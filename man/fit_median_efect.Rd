\title{Fit median-effect model for 2-drug combination with a fixed ratio desgin}
\usage{
fit_median_efect(
  d1,
  d2,
  e,
  name1 = "Drug A",
  name2 = "Drug B",
  d2.d1,
  base = exp(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1}{dose for drug 1.}

\item{d2}{dose for drug 2.}

\item{e}{corresponding response in the range [0, 1].}

\item{name1}{drug 1 name.}

\item{name2}{drug 2 name.}

\item{d2.d1}{d2/d1, the fixed ratio.}

\item{base}{base of logarithm; disabled since the dose-response curve estimation also
needs transformation.}
}
\value{
a list.
}
\description{
Notice that the median-effect model is a special case of the sigma Emax model; 
 3 linear models are fitted; fixed ratio thus is required. All 3 linear models are fitted
 using logit(E) ~ log(d1+d2) using a subset of the data depending on if the data is for durg 1,
 drug 2 and the mixture
