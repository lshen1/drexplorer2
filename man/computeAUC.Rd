\title{Calculate AUC from a fitted object}
\usage{
computeAUC(fit, dmin, dmax, islogd = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{usually a drFit object. However, any object with a predict method would work.}

\item{dmin}{minimum dose. The integral range is [dmin, dmax].}

\item{dmax}{maximum dose. The integral range is [dmin, dmax].}

\item{islogd}{whether the supplied dose dmin/dmax is in log10 scale. The user should be
responsible for the consistency between the actual value of dmin, dmax and islogd. If
log10 transformed dmin/dmax is supplied with islogd = TRUE, the AUC is calculated based on
dose-response curve with x-axis being log10(dose); On the other hand, if dmin, dmax is original
scale and islogd = FALSE, the AUC is calculated based on a dose-response curve with x-axis
being dose.}
}
\value{
a vector of AUC, AUC0 and AUCs. AUC is the area under dose response curve; AUC0 is
 the area under the line response = 1; AUCS is AUC/AUC0
}
\description{
AUC is calculated through the integrate() function based on dose-response curve.

\examples{
data(ryegrass, package = 'drc') # use the ryegrass data from drc package
fit.sigEmax <- drFit(drMat=ryegrass[, c(2, 1)], modelName = "sigEmax", alpha = 0.01, fitCtr = FALSE)
computeAUC(fit.sigEmax, dmin = -0.027, dmax = 1.477, islogd = TRUE)
