\usage{
plot_median_effect(
  medianEffect,
  type = c("medianEffect", "doseResponseCurve", "contour"),
  contour.level = (1:9)/10,
  logd = FALSE,
  cex.legend = 1,
  align = TRUE,
  ylim = c(0, 1),
  legend.position = "topright"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{medianEffect}{the fitted result by fit_median_efect().}

\item{type}{type of plot, options are from c('medianEffect', 'doseResponseCurve', 'contour').}

\item{contour.level}{levels (between 0 and 1 representing different response values) to draw
contour plot.}

\item{logd}{whether to plot logd in Dose-response curve; only effective if 
type=='doseResponseCurve'.}

\item{cex.legend}{cex for the legend text'.}

\item{align}{whether to align dose range. Imagine that 2 drugs are mixed in fixed ratio,
the doses in one drug will have low doses that the other drug and mixture do not have 
which some biologists deams as a waste of graphic region. An easy fix is to truncate xlim.
This is only only effective if type=='doseResponseCurve'.}

\item{ylim}{limits on y axis. Default is set between 0 and 1.}

\item{legend.position}{legend position passed to legend() function.}
